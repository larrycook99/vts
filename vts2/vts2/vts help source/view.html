	 <a name="vts"></a><b>VTS Packet Trace</b><br>
	 VTS records a history of the BACnet packets it transmits and receives for you to 
	 view and/or save at any time. You can display or hide the VTS packet trace window 
	 at any time by using the View/Target Device Window menu. The packet trace window 
	 operates in real-time, so as soon as BACnet packets are sent and received they 
	 are displayed in the packet trace window.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 <img src="view_withhex.jpg" border="0">
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Separate panes are displayed for transmitted and received packets. The verbose description 
	 of the packet and the corresponding hex value are optional and can be turned on and off 
	 using the View menu. You can choose to display both transmitted and received packets 
	 or transmitted only or received only packets through the View menu. Each pane can be 
	 cleared individually using the View menu or by double-clicking on the Rx or Tx label on 
	 the packet trace window. Segmented BACnet packets appear in the panes totally assembled, 
	 i.e. as if they were single large unsegmented packets. 
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 <a name="vtssave"></a><b>Saving VTS Packet Traces</b><br>
	 The VTS packet traces can be saved for later viewing by using the VTS File/Save PDU File 
	 and File/Open PDU File menus respectively. The transmit and receive panes can be 
	 saved separately.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 VTS saves the packet traces in plain-text format, so they can be easily searched and edited 
	 using any plain-text editor such as Notepad.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 <a name="nalserv"></a><b>NALSERV32 Packet Trace</b><br>
	 NALSERV32 maintains its own real-time history of transmitted and received packets always in raw hex 
	 format. Separate panes are displayed for transmitted and received packets. You can 
	 choose to display both transmitted and received packets or transmitted only or 
	 received only using the NALSERV32 View menu. Each pane can be cleared individually 
	 by clicking on the Rx or Tx label on the NALSERV32 status window. Segmented 
	 BACnet packets appear in the panes as totally  assembled packets, i.e. as if 
	 they were single large unsegmented packets. Because NALSERV32 is capable of 
	 transmitting packets automatically, e.g. periodic Who-Is-Requests and I-Am-Requests, there may not 
	 be a one-to-one correspondence between the VTS transmit/receive packet history and the 
	 NALSERV32 transmit/receive packet history.   
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 A sample VTS packet trace and NALSERV32 status window are shown together for 
	 your comparison. Note that the first octet of a BACnet-Confirmed-Request-PDU, 
	 in this example the ReadProperty-Request, does not agree between the VTS and 
	 NALSERV32 packet trace. This is because the SEG, MOR and SA fields of the PDU's 
	 first octet are added by NALSERV32 as needed after being called by VTS. Click 
	 <a href="nalserv32.html#using">here</a> for more details about the NALSERV32 
	 status window.

	 <p>
	 <a name="ptp"></a><b>PTP Packet Trace</b><br>
	 PTP maintains its own real-time history of transmitted and received PTP frames always in raw hex 
	 format. Separate panes are displayed for transmitted and received frames. Each 
	 pane can be cleared individually using the PTP View menu. The PTP packet trace shows all 
	 PTP frames including PTP Heartbeat, Connect and Disconnect, which do not appear 
	 in the VTS trace window because they are handled directly in the PTP module.

	 Because <b>all</b> BACnet application layer and network layer packets are passed through 
	 NALSERV32 regardless of the data link layer and physical layer, the NALSERV32 status window 
	 also shows those types of packets that are sent to a PTP port. Click 
	 <a href="nalserv32.html#using">here</a> for more details about the NALSERV32 status window.

	 <a name="mstp"></a><b>MSTP Packet Trace</b><br>
	 MSTP maintains its own real-time history of transmitted and received MS/TP frames always in raw hex 
	 format. Separate panes are displayed for transmitted and received frames. Each 
	 pane can be cleared individually using the MSTP View menu. The MSTP packet trace shows all 
	 MS/TP frames including MS/TP Token (Pass), Poll for Master, Reply to Poll for Master, etc., 
	 which do not appear in the VTS trace window because they are handled directly in the MSTP module.
